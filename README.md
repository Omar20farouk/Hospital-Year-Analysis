Hospital Performance Analysis: Improving Revenue Realization
​Project Overview
​This analysis evaluates a hospital's operational performance from January to December 2023. Despite maintaining stable patient volumes and 100% insurance coverage, the facility faces a significant revenue collection gap and operational inefficiencies. The goal of this project is to move from peak demand toward sustainable profitability.
​Key Problems Identified
​Low Revenue Collection Rate: The hospital only collects 31.5% of its expected revenue, totaling £173.42K out of £551.25K.
​High No-Show Rate: "No-Show" is the most frequent appointment status, exceeding completed appointments and wasting clinical resources.
​Payment Imbalance: Combined Pending (£184.61K) and Failed (£193.21K) revenue exceeds the total amount paid.
​Performance Inconsistency: Revenue per doctor is identical regardless of individual appointment volumes, indicating a lack of performance-based incentives.
​Seasonal Volatility: Patient inflow peaks sharply in September, leading to staffing and resource misalignment during other months.
​Operational & Strategic Fixes
​Reduce No-Shows: Implement automated SMS/WhatsApp reminders and introduces penalties or deposits for high-risk bookings.
​Strengthen Collections: Establish a dedicated billing team and track failed claims by insurance provider to identify specific rejection reasons.
​Incentivize Productivity: Link revenue incentives to completed appointments and actual revenue collected rather than just patient volume.
​Demand Balancing: Promote services during low-demand months and align doctor schedules with historical peak trends.
​Technical Skills
​Power BI: Created comprehensive dashboards for Overview, Doctors, Patients, and Revenue.
​Data Analysis: Performed revenue realization mapping and patient growth trend analysis.
​Strategic Planning: Developed an actionable conclusion focused on cash flow and profitability without expanding capacity.
